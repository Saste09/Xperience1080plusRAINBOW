COLOURED OR TEXTURED TILES:

1. pick the color you want for any section on homescreen
2. COPY your chosen "colour.png" to "copy your choice in here" folder.
3. rename copied "colour.png" to "tile-yoursection.png"   
   e.g. i want tvshows-section tiles to be coloured cyan on homescreen:
   	-->  rename "cyan.png" to "tile-tvshows.png"
4. COPY your renamed tile to "//skin.xperience1080+CMYK/media/windows/home"
5. open XBMC and enjoy your new coloured Skin ;)
(Same steps with textures)

COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT TILES:


1. copy ALL FILES from "03 Transparent Look" to "//media/windows/home"
2. That's it.

To undo this just copy FILES from "02 Original BackUp Files" to "//media/windows/home"


NAME FOR EACH SECTION:

Search:		tile-search.png
Live-TV:	tile-livetv.png
Home: 		tile-home.png
TVShows:	tile-tvshows.png
Music:		tile-music.png --> if you change music section 
				   "colour-addedtile.png" has to be renamed to 
				   "addedtile.png" and copied to same folder as "tile-music.png"
Applications:	tile-apps.png
Weather:	tile-weather.png + tile-weather2.png
Settings:	tile-system.png


Now have fun designing your individual Xperience1080+RAINBOW Skin 

Cheers 
Saste
